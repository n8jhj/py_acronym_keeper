= To Do

* [ ] Command `self` to activate shell completion according to directions at: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/
* [ ] Multiple TOML files for, e.g., version control in separate repos.
** [ ] Allow users to register multiple file paths for different docs. These dirs could conceivably be in Git repos, or other kinds of VCS repos.
* [ ] Sugar for pushing/pulling updates via Git (and possibly other VCSes).
** [ ] Decide whether to support Git only, or other VCSes as well.
** [ ] Document the decision.
* [ ] Groups or tags to associate acronyms with each other and facilitate sorting/filtering. Could be implemented as another field in the TOML, an array of strings.
** [ ] Could be used to allow transferring entire groups to other TOML files.
** [ ] Ability to reorganize (merge, delete, rename) groups without data loss.
* [ ] Allow multiple reference links.
* [ ] Links to alternate meanings of the same acronym.
* [ ] "As opposed to" field to help find related acronyms/terms.
// cspell:ignore QSPI
* [ ] "See also" links to related acronyms. Esp. intended for acronyms that are slight variations of each other, such as SPI and QSPI.
